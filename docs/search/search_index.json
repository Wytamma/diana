Transposon-Insertion Sequencing (abbreviated as TIS, HITS, INSeq, TraDIS, and Tn-Seq) is a powerful functional genomics technique used to determine the roles of genes across an entire genome. TIS combines random transposon mutagenesis with high-throughput sequencing of the transposon insertion sites to identify essential genes, virulence factors, and genes involved in antibiotic resistance or environmental persistence.</p> <p>Although TIS methods differ in methods, they all rely on the same basic principles: a transposon is inserted randomly into the genome of a bacterium, and the resulting mutant library is subjected to high-throughput sequencing. The sequencing data is then analysed to identify the locations of the transposon insertions and to determine which genes are essential for growth or survival under specific conditions.</p>"},{"location":"#how-can-i-create-tis-data","title":"How can I create TIS data?","text":"<p>There are many ways to generate TIS data e.g. TraDIS, HITS, INSeq, Tn-Seq.
